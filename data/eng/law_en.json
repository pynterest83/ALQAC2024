Horticulture is an economic-technical branch of agriculture related to the cultivation of agricultural crops, ornamental plants and edible mushrooms to serve human purposes.\n\n2. Cultivation activities include activities on plant varieties; fertilizer; culture; harvesting, preliminary processing, preservation, processing, trade and quality management of crop products.\n\n3. Farming is the process where people use natural resources, equipment, agricultural supplies and apply production processes to create different crop products.\n\n4. Crop products are harvested parts of agricultural crops, ornamental plants and edible mushrooms.\n\n5. A plant variety is a plant population that can be distinguished from other plant populations through the expression of at least one characteristic and can be inherited to future generations; Homogeneous in morphology, stable through breeding cycles; has cultivation value and use value; including agricultural plant varieties, medicinal plant varieties, ornamental plant varieties and edible mushroom varieties.\n\n6. Propagation materials are plants or parts of plants, edible mushrooms or parts of edible mushrooms that can grow into a new individual, used for propagation or planting.\n\n7. Major plant species are commonly grown plants that are important in economic development and need to be strictly managed.\n\n8. Annual plants are plants that are planted, harvested and end their production cycle within no more than 01 year, including annual plants that are saved at the root.\n\n9. Perennial crops are plants that are planted once, grow for many years and are harvested one or more times.\n\n10. Distinctiveness of a plant variety is the ability of a plant variety to clearly distinguish it from widely known plant varieties.\n\n11. Uniformity of a plant variety is the similar expression of a plant variety in terms of related traits, except for deviations within the allowable range for some specific traits during the breeding process.\n\n12. Stability of a plant variety is the stable expression of relevant characteristics as initially described, remaining unchanged after each breeding season or after each breeding cycle in the case of cyclic breeding. period.\n\n13. Plant variety testing is the activity of monitoring and evaluating criteria to determine the distinctiveness, uniformity, stability, cultivation value, and use value of a plant variety according to a certain method. .\n\n14. Controlled testing is testing of plant varieties in an artificial environment so that the plant variety fully demonstrates the characteristics of resistance to harmful organisms and unfavorable conditions.\n\n15. Fertilizer testing is the activity of monitoring and evaluating criteria to determine the method of use, environmental impact, agronomic efficiency, and economic efficiency of fertilizers.\n\n16. Narrow-area testing is a testing conducted in the field, on a small plot area, with repetitions, and arranged in accordance with national standards on testing methods for the tested subjects.\n\n17. Large-scale testing is a testing conducted in the field, on a large plot area, without repetition, and arranged according to national standards on testing methods for the tested subjects.\n\n18. A leading plant is the best plant selected and recognized from the population of a plant variety.\n\n19. Top-of-the-line tree garden is a tree garden propagated from a first-line tree or a tree garden established by an organization or individual that is evaluated and recognized.\n\n20. Fertilizer is a product that has the function of providing nutrients or improving soil to increase productivity and quality of plants.\n\n21. Fertilizer quality indicators are technical specifications on characteristics, composition, and content that reflect the quality of fertilizers specified in the corresponding applicable technical regulations and standards.\n\n22. Nutrient elements in fertilizers are chemical elements necessary for plant growth and development."
